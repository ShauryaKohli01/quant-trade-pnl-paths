# Is Quant Trading Gambling?


We’ll explore the similarities between quantitative trading and games of chance like poker (specifically Texas Hold’em). We’ll discuss concepts like edge,
decision-making under uncertainty, and visualize how these ideas play out in both trading and poker.

# Games of Chance v. Games of Incomplete Information

Edge in Games of Chance: Roulette


1. The house’s edge exists in some games of chance by construction.

2. This game of chance [roulette] offers the house a slight theoretical edge which leads to a theoretical accumulation of positive expected value over time.

3. Of course, the actual wealth path itself is stochastic so the casino and players can still lose or make money in the short run but in the long run there should be relative convergence
to this theoretical edge in the form of P/L for the casino (or no casinos would be in business).


# Edge in Games of Incomplete Information: Poker
Poker is a game of incomplete information. Each player must make decisions based on their hand, the 
visible cards, and their beliefs about opponents’ hands. The Bellman equation, a fundamental concept in 
reinforcement learning and dynamic programming, helps us think about optimal actions in such uncertain environments.


# Bellman Equation (for reference):

In poker, as in trading, the goal is to accumulate positive expected value (EV) over time. 
This means making decisions that, on average, will lead to profit, even if individual outcomes are uncertain.


# Edge in Games of Incomplete Information: Trading


Trading is a more chaotic game of incomplete information with many moving pieces including but not limited to…

1. Macro factors like inflation, interest rates

2. Administration like U.S. government, policy, regulation

3. Industry trajectory like technology, advancements and adoptions

4. Firm specific trajectory, a firm’s cashflows, earnings, products

The only thing that is certain in this game is that your model is wrong and subject to change at any given time.

Theoretical edge in this capacity exists from experience in tandem with models. A good reference is any work on Deep Bellman Hedging (Hans Buehler) or job listings for traders: if experience had nothing to do with trading and it were all luck why would we hire an experienced trader? Moreover, we couldn’t learn anything of the true asset price distribution from an empirical distribution like Buehler et al.



Turns out, understanding what decisions to make in the face of uncertainty (trading, poker: games of incomplete information) comes from experiencing the environment in tandem with more abstract models.
Poker players decide when to raise, call, or fold. Traders decide when to buy, sell or hold.

Both domains require acting optimally under uncertainty, using available information to maximize long-term gains.


# Edge Accumulation: Sample Paths

Let's simulate the P/L (Profit and Loss) of a strategy with a small positive edge over time, similar to a skilled poker player or a quant trading strategy.

# Conclusion: Is Quant Trading Gambling?
Both quant trading and poker involve risk, uncertainty, and the need for optimal decision-making. The key difference is that, in trading, we seek to find and exploit persistent edge — just like a skilled poker player does. If our edge is real and stable, we expect to accumulate profits over time. If not, both activities can devolve into gambling.

The line between gambling and trading is the presence of a true, sustainable edge and the discipline to act on it optimally.
